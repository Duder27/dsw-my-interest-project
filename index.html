         The Los Padres National Forest is a protected landscape made up of rocky coastline, expansive mountain ranges, oak forests, and winding rivers. The incredibly
           complex web of interactions that take place in this land are all an important part of the delicate balance of this intersection of ecosystems.
           Many of them are very important in the health and wellbeing of the surrounding land, and the world at large. For example, the woody shrubs in the hilly chapparal
           biomes are invaluable in preserving the stability of the ground and mountains they grow on, as they prevent erosion. <br> 
           I was lucky enough to be raised in this breathtaking place, and I am very passionate about it. I frequently wander the mountain trails surrounding my house,
           and make excursions to the creek that's just down the hill from me. I love relaxing in the crook of an oak tree, or basking on a sunlit rock. 
           I am so thankful that this unique and beautiful ecosystem has been preserved for all to enjoy.

        In 1898, the Pine Mountain and Zaca Lake Forest Reserve was established. It was later renamed the Santa Barbara Forest Reserve, and eventually merged with the 
        Santa Ynez, San Luis and Monterey forest reserves to become the Los Padres National Forest.

        There are an incredible number of diverse habitats within these protected lands. They contain just the right conditions for everything from dry lowlands to snowy peaks. 
        Some of these habitats include: Riparian (creekside) zones with unique ecology and species interactions, high altitude redwood forests, chaparral biomes,
        oak woodlands housing everything from Mountain Lions to Scrub Jays, flat grasslands, scorching semi-desert areas and even rocky coastline and marine habitats.
