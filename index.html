      <h1> The Los Padres National Forest</h1>
       <img src="figueroa-mtn-road.jpg" alt="Los Padres Wilderness" width="550" height="413">
       <p> The Los Padres National Forest is a protected landscape made up of Chaparral, expansive mountain ranges, oak forests, and winding rivers. The incredibly
           complex and delicate web of interactions that take place in this land are all an important part of the delicate balance of this intersection of ecosystems.
           Many of them are very important in the health and wellbeing of other ecosystems, and the world at large. For example, the large shrubs in the hilly chapparal
           biome are invaluable in preserving the stability of the ground and mountains they grow on, preventing erosion. <br> 
           I was lucky enough to be raised in this breathtaking place, and I am very passionate about it. I frequently wander the mountain trails surrounding my house,
           and make excursions to the creek that is just down the hill from me. I love relaxing in the crook of an oak tree, or basking on a sunlit rock near the creek. 
           I am so thankful that this unique and beautiful ecosystem has been preserved for all to enjoy.
