       <p> The Los Padres National Forest is a protected landscape made up of Chaparral, expansive mountain ranges, oak forests, and winding rivers.
       I was lucky enough to be raised in this breathtaking place, and I am very passionate about it. I frequently wander the mountain trails surrounding my house,
       and make excursions to the creek that is just down the hill from me. I love relaxing in the crook of an oak tree, or basking on a sunlit rock near the creek. 
       I am so thankful this unique and beautiful ecosystem has been preserved for all to enjoy.
